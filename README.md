## How to install

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- git clone https://github.com/felixyunianto/laravel-sass.git
- cd laravel-sass/
- composer update ([download composer](https://getcomposer.org/))
- copy .env.example then rename to .env
- php artisan key:generate
- npm install
- php artisan serve

Good luck and have a nice day.
